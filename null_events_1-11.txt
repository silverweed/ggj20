The journey is long.

event null_2

Perils await you on this journey. But nothing relevant happened this time.

event null_3
---
A bunch of metal spikes and plates protrude for the terrain ahead, remnants of human vehicles, mostly rusted away. Easy to step over or walk around.

> Nothing useful here
[] home
end 


event null_4
---
You spot the remains of a walled citadel entrenched atop a nearby hill.
A wide breach in the corroded walls seem to suggest how the settlement might have met its end.

end 


event null_5
---
Dead trees and branches give way to the weight of the automaton.
The dry wood too brittle to be useful, now only serve as a reminder of the once lush forests that covered the areas.

end 


event null_6
---
The AI sensors flag various warnings. /!\ THREATS INCOMING /!\ The sirens on board trigger simultaneously breaking the stillness in the open air.

> Take a defensive position and ready for combat
[] null_6_1

end 

event null_6_1
---
The heavy machine stops. No more thuds or shaking. Only a clear and sharp warning piercing the ears of nearby wild life. Nothing happens, the sensors must’ve picked up a false alarm.
---
> Better get those sensors checked
[] home
end

event null_6_2
---
The engine starts pumping more fuel, thick billowing smoke is vomited from the chimney as the moving fortress picks up speed. After a short time the sensors go quiet. Looking back, nothing can be seen.
---
> Was there something hiding or or was it a system malfunction?

end

event null_7
---
A small infight breaks in the living quarters.
Fortunately, nothing of consequence happens.

end 


event null_8
---
The loud crashing sounds of the claws echo in the valley.
Occasionally, the claws slip on the smooth rocks, in search for stable footing.
---
> Continue
[] home
end 

event null_9
---
A skewed large metal sign emerges from the tall grass. It looks like a signpost to the remnants of a service station.

> Investigate
[] null_9_1
> It’s clearly a waste of time, move along
[] home
end 

event null_9_1
---
The half submerged tanks are dry. Grass and other thin bushes are growing at the bottom of one of the gas tanks.
---
> Nothing useful here
[] home
end

event null_10
---
A lonely hut stands atop a nearby hill, a little away from the current course.
The sensors do not not detect any sign of life.
---
> Approach the building
[] null_10_1
> Ignore the hut and continue on the journey
[] home
end 

event null_10_1
---
Barely standing under its own weight, the small building trembles as the automaton approaches.
Whoever lived in the hut, has long since left, and now only dust remains.

> Continue
[] home
end 

event null_11
---
A thin column of smoke grabs the automaton’s attention. At its source, a group of four mud huts and metal shacks, placed in a circle, can be seen in the distance.

> Approach the tiny settlement

> Avoid this interaction

end 

event null_11_1
---
Lifeless bodies are put on display around the settlement. Raiders must have made it here first.

> Help arrived too late
