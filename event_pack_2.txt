event Env_1 
title Roots & Rain
---
Jagged rocks and large boulders, fragments of a recently collapsed rocky hill, block your path. Freshly cut timber, splintered wood and seed-loaded boughs can be seen protruding here and there along with large rounded saw blades and other pieces of broken machinery.

> Climb the rough terrain and salvage what’s available.

> Move around the hill and collect whatever has rolled at the bottom of the landslide.

As the sturdy legs sink into the mud and avoid gaps in the rubble, the arm reaches below, taking a hold on whatever is useful.

The metal legs slip and the body wacks against the ruined sawmill. The Hull integrity suffered damage. Nevertheless, Fuel, Seeds and Misc. Mats were gathered while trespassing the rough terrain.

No incidents occurred. Feet and claws hold steadily on solid terrain as all essentials are loaded in the cargo hold. Seeds and Misc. Mats were gathered  while crossing the remains of the sawmill.

Picking the safest route also means obtaining the least useful things. Boulders are easy to avoid and the terrain below is always visible, preventing a ruinous fall.

Not much that it isn’t rubble lays around the area. Circumnavigating the hill resulted in obtaining a few seeds and mats.

There’s only one way forward. No choice lies ahead. Sharp rocks, snow covering every inch of the narrow pass.

One leg after the other, the heavy machinery trembled until a misstep leads it dangerously down a ravine.

The relatively light weight of the moving-city prevented it from suffering extra damage. However, the hull still took a blow.
