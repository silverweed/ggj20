A bunch of metal spikes and plates protrude for the terrain ahead, remnants of human vehicles, mostly rusted away. Easy to step over or walk around.

You spot the remains of a walled citadel entrenched atop a nearby hill.
A wide breach in the corroded walls seem to suggest how the settlement might have met its end.

Dead trees and branches give way to the weight of the automaton.
The dry wood, too brittle to be useful, now only serves as a reminder of the once lush forests that covered the area.

The AI sensors flag various warnings. /!\ THREATS INCOMING /!\ The sirens on board trigger simultaneously breaking the stillness in the open air.

The heavy machine stops. No more thuds or shaking. Only a clear and sharp warning piercing the ears of nearby wild life. Nothing happens, the sensors must’ve picked up a false alarm.

The engine starts pumping more fuel, thick billowing smoke is vomited from the chimney as the moving fortress picks up speed. After a short time the sensors go quiet. Looking back, nothing can be seen.

The loud crashing sounds of the claws echo in the valley.
Occasionally, the claws slip on the smooth rocks, in search for stable footing.

A skewed large metal sign emerges from the tall grass. It looks like a signpost to the remnants of a service station.

A lonely hut stands atop a nearby hill, a little away from the current course.
The sensors do not not detect any sign of life.

Barely standing under its own weight, the small building trembles as the automaton approaches.
Whoever lived in the hut, has long since left, and now only dust remains.

A thin column of smoke grabs the automaton’s attention. At its source, a group of four mud huts and metal shacks, placed in a circle, can be seen in the distance.

A tall, slender tower stands in the distance.
The sensors read a faint signal coming from the ancient construction.

The superstitious humans advise you to avoid the place. Stories tell that nothing good ever came out of it.

The menacing tower loses more of its appeal at each step. Holes and gaps become more and more visible. No inquiry is needed, the silence suffices to reveal there is nothing left here.

As expected, no human life can be found. Small rodents take shelter in holes in the concrete, waiting for the automaton to leave.

As the metal creature reaches the top of a hill, a large crater can be seen in the distance. A short detour could get you close enough to see if there’s anything interesting.

Grass grows at the bottom of the crater, roughly 1km in diameter. Blocks of stone, or maybe smoothed cement, pop out of the tall grass, especially around the small ponds that have formed here and there.
